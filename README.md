 - Design with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

TinDog's frontend design is a testament to the power of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Here's how these technologies were used:

- **HTML**: The project structure is built with HTML, ensuring proper semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.

- **CSS**: Extensive CSS styles have been applied to create an attractive and cohesive design, with attention to fonts, colors, buttons, and hover effects.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, was leveraged for streamlining design elements. It provided components like navigation bars, cards for pricing and features, responsive grids, buttons, and carousels for testimonials.
